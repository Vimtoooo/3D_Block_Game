# Minecraft Knock-off (Replica made by me)

## Brief Resume:

I am attempting to build not only a game, but one of the most well-known games made to human kind, Minecraft!
For this incredible project, I will mention what modules that I will be using, along with a list of methods with an explanation that describes what happens behind the scenes.

### Modules & External Files:

* `Ursina`: A basic 3D game modelling dependency, allowing for the functionality, mapping and easy game development such as terrain generation, inventory system, hotbar, game controls and much more features.
* `Main.py`: This is where the main program will be executed.
* `Terrain.py`: Focuses on defining single blocks and how it behaves.
* `Player.py`: Maintains player functionality and manipulates how the user can interact with other entities.
